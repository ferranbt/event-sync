# Event-sync

There are two things every blockchain developer eventually builds: a system to read and sync on-chain events, and a transaction load tester. This project hopefully saves you from building the former from scratch.

This workspace provides both the building blocks (tools and primitives) to create your own event syncing system, as well as a complete event syncer implementation ready to use out of the box.
